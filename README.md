Define the DISTANCE base class that calculates the distance between two points given by their coordinates in the n-dimensional space. As its successor, create DECARTES, CHEBISHEV and HEMMING classes that calculate the distance between points in Cartesian, Chebyshev and Hemming spaces. Let the roo() function, which calculates the distance between points, be defined as polymorphic.
